# Caculate rough estimate of how much memory dataset will require before reading into R

# Subset dataset from 2007-02-01 to 2007-02-002

# Convert Date and Time to Date/Time classes in R
strptime()
as.Date()

# Missing values ?

# 4 plots,
## Construct plot and save it to PNG file (w = 480, h = 480)
## name them (plot1.png)
## Create R code file (plot1.R), include code for reading data, code for creating PNG file
## Add PNG file and R code into git repository

# Final output should be 4 PNG files + 4 R code files
